#ACM
first build!
##Build an Authentication API with Node, Express, and Mongo

To run app, go to server directory and enter `nodemon index.js`
then in another terminal window, cd into the client folder and
run `npm start` at the moment you will have to append the URL
like this `localhost:8080/login` and `localhost:8080/register` to
have the pages load (this is temporary of course)

Basic authentication with NodeJS, Express, and Mongodb.
Basically going to take things step by step to setup the basics
of a software as a service or any other type of site that requires
authentication.

The application will be split into two parts, the client-side code
will go into the **client** directory and the server-side code will go
into the **server** directory. This makes our application more manageable
once it starts getting more complex and the files grow!
Beginning of the ACM project.
